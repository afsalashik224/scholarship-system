# 🎓 Student Scholarship Management System

A full-stack web application that streamlines the end-to-end scholarship lifecycle — from student discovery and application to admin review and decision-making.

Built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- A MongoDB connection string ([MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) free tier works)

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd scholarship-backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your values (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)), then:

```bash
npm run dev       # starts with nodemon on http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd scholarship-frontend
npm install
npm start         # starts on http://localhost:3000
```

The React dev server proxies all `/api/*` requests to `localhost:5000` via the `"proxy"` field in `package.json` — no CORS configuration needed during development.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `scholarship-backend/` using `.env.example` as a template:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | Express server port | `5000` |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string | `mongodb+srv://...` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for signing JWTs | any long random string |
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime environment | `development` |

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env` to version control. It is listed in `.gitignore`.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Passwords are hashed with **bcryptjs** before storage — never stored in plain text.
- JWT tokens expire after **7 days**; re-login is required after expiry.
- A student cannot apply to the same scholarship twice — enforced at both API and database level.
- Files are served statically from `uploads/` via Express — suitable for local development and small deployments.
- The `uploads/` directory is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Email notifications on application status change (Nodemailer / SendGrid)
- [ ] Pagination for scholarship and application listings
- [ ] Student profile page with application history and document library
- [ ] Admin analytics dashboard (applications per scholarship, approval rate)
- [ ] Cloud file storage (Cloudinary or AWS S3) to replace local Multer storage
- [ ] Deployment pipeline (Render for backend, Vercel for frontend, MongoDB Atlas)
- [ ] Unit and integration tests (Jest + Supertest)
